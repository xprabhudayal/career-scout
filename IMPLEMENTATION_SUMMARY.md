# Implementation Summary

## What's Been Implemented

### Authentication System
- **Authentication Page**: A light-themed authentication page that offers:
  - Email/password login
  - Magic link login
  - Google OAuth
- **Auth Callback**: Handler for processing authentication callbacks from Supabase

### Onboarding Flow
- **Multi-step Onboarding**: A smooth onboarding flow with animated transitions:
  1. Welcome screen
  2. Name input
  3. Role selection (Developer, Designer, etc.)
  4. Usage selection (Company, Agency, etc.)
  5. Success screen with auto-redirect
- **Theme Toggle**: Users can toggle between light and dark mode during onboarding
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators showing progress through the onboarding flow
- **Persistence**: Saves user preferences to Supabase

### Route Protection & Navigation
- **Middleware**: Checks authentication and onboarding status on all protected routes
- **Redirects**: Intelligently redirects users based on their status:
  - Non-authenticated users → Auth page
  - Authenticated but not onboarded → Onboarding flow
  - Fully onboarded users → Dashboard

### Database Schema
- **User Preferences Table**: Stores user preferences with proper Row Level Security
- **RLS Policies**: Ensures users can only access their own data
- **Service Role**: Admin operations can bypass RLS using the service role client

## How to Run the Project

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env.local` file with:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
   ```

3. **Set Up Supabase**:
   - Create a new project in Supabase
   - Run the SQL in `setup/user_preferences.sql` to create tables and policies
   - Configure Authentication providers in the Supabase dashboard

4. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Key Files and Their Purpose

- `middleware.js`: Handles authentication and route protection
- `lib/supabaseClient.js`: Sets up regular and service role clients
- `components/AuthenticationScreen.jsx`: Handles login/signup UI
- `components/OnboardingFlow.jsx`: Manages the multi-step onboarding with animations
- `components/Providers.jsx`: Provides authentication context throughout the app
- `components/ThemeProvider.jsx`: Manages theme state and persistence
- `app/auth/callback/route.js`: Processes Supabase auth callbacks
- `setup/user_preferences.sql`: Database schema and RLS policies

## Note on Architecture

This implementation follows a "protection by middleware" architecture where:
1. The middleware checks the user's authentication and onboarding status
2. Routes redirect appropriately based on this status
3. Components double-check authentication status client-side as a fallback

This ensures that protected content is only accessible to authenticated and properly onboarded users.
